### REST API File Guide:
**UPDATE AS FILES ARE ADDED.**
In `/little-guy-creator-web/api/`
- `index.php`: entry point for REST API calls
- `Controller/Api/BaseController.php`: helper methods for API requests
- `Controller/Api/LittleGuyController.php`: handles specific implementation details for each type of API request (see table below)

### How to run locally:
**UPDATE AS PARAMETERS ARE ADDED.**
1. Install XAMPP and start your server, navigate to localhost/phpmyadmin/ in your browser (or equivalent depending on the xampp specifications for your OS), and under the SQL tab run the following command:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE `app-db`;

CREATE TABLE `app-db`.`users`(
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE `app-db`.`little-guys`(
    id INT(11) PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    head_variant INT(2) NOT NULL,
    head_hex INT(8) NOT NULL,
    face_variant INT(2) NOT NULL,
    face_color INT(1) NOT NULL,
    body_variant INT(2) NOT NULL,
    body_hex INT(8) NOT NULL,
    arms_variant INT(2) NOT NULL,
    arms_hex INT(8) NOT NULL,
    legs_variant INT(2) NOT NULL,
    legs_hex INT(8) NOT NULL,
    iq VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (username) REFERENCES `users`(username)
        ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```

2. Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

3. Edit the file `/little-guy-creator-web/api/inc/config.php`. It currently looks like this:
```php
<?php
define("DB_HOST", "localhost");
define("DB_USERNAME", "root");
define("DB_PASSWORD", "");
define("DB_DATABASE_NAME", "app-db");
define("SECRET_KEY", "your-secret-key");
define("TOKEN_ISSUER", "little-guy-creator");
?>
```
Replace the definitions for host, username, and password to match your user account (information found under the accounts tab in phpmyadmin). Replace the definition for secret key with a long, random string of charactersâ€”this is the key used to generate authentication tokens. You may optionally change the definition for token issuer.

4. Put the contents of `/little-guy-creator-web/` into the htdocs folder on your machine (located in the xampp folder). **Put all files straight into htdocs, not in its own folder.**

5. In your terminal, `cd` into `htdocs/api/` then run the command `composer install`

### How to use the site:

From the landing page, use the far-right button on the navigation bar at the top (labelled "sign in") to sign in to the site. You may either sign in to an existing account or register a new account using the link below the entry fields. After logging in, the site will direct you to the home page, where the CRUD functionality is. The home page displays all of the users Little Guys, as well as all the Little Guys of the other users.

You may Create a little guy using the link titled "Create a new Little Guy". After making at least one little guy, little guys can be Read and are displayed at the top of the page. The little guys can be Updated using the "edit" button to the right of your little guy, and can be Deleted using the "edit" button and then opting to delete.

## Using the REST API
**UPDATE AS PARAMETERS ARE ADDED.**
The following table describes API calls that can be made.

Use the base URL `http://localhost/api/index.php`, where `localhost` can be replaced with however you are running the backend server.

Protected calls require an authorization header `'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE'`
